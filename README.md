## Nationalratswahlen Basel 2023
On 2023-10-22 Nationalratswahlen took place in Switzerland, so also in Basel.
The results can be seen on https://www.staatskanzlei.bs.ch/politische-rechte/wahlen-abstimmungen/wahlen-2023.html
including the protocols how the 4 Basel seats in the Nationalrat were assigned.

Open government data allow to retrieve the vote counts and reconstruct the seat assignment process,
this is done in the script **nationalratswahlen_2023.R** and, with some additional text, in the 
Rmarkdown document **nationalratswahlen_2023.Rmd**.

The Rmarkdown document can be read conveniently on https://rpubs.com/reikoch/basel_nationalratswahlen_2023.
